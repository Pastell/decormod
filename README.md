# Decor Mod (tentative title)
A Minecraft mod for versions 1.12+ to add additional decorative blocks to Minecraft.

## Disclaimer of Dumbness
I am not good at programming. I am not good at art. I'm doing this for fun, and I cannot guarantee that
anything will work. At all. It is a dumb, bad mod. Seriously.

## Content
- Hay, farmed with Hay Seed. Currently craftable into Thatch, but you can't get the seeds naturally.
- Eperine Ore, smeltable into Eperine Ingot. Doesn't generate yet.
- Eperine Ingot, made from smelting Eperine Ore. Currently useless.
- Thatch, directionally place-able block for rustic roofing.
- Eperine Bricks, green-ish blue brick variant. Has carved and cracked variants. Currently uncraftable.

## To-Do
- Make hay seeds drop from tall grass.
- Make hay feedable to horses and cows.
- Convert Eperine Ore into a Lapis Lazuli or Redstone like ore, dropping Eperine Fibers(Unimplemented) instead.
- Add Eperine Clay, crafted from Eperine Fibers and Clay, smeltable into Eperine Bricks.
- Make Eperine Brick decorative blocks.
